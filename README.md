# Indee Watch 2.1 API Demo (Vue.js)

## Overview

This repository contains a demonstration of the Indee Watch 2.1 API using a Vue.js application. The demo showcases the following capabilities:

- Displaying brands, projects, and videos associated with a given FYC (For Your Consideration) token in a tabular format.
- Automatic detection of API keys for screeners or Global Distribution, prompting for username and password to display corresponding data.

## Important Notice

**⚠️ This code is intended for demonstration purposes only. ⚠️**

Do not use API keys directly in client-side applications. For production use, always store API keys securely on your server and use them to establish the initial session through the `login` API.

- Node.js installed on your system (version specified in `.nvmrc`)
- API key and endpoint provided by Indee

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Update the following environment variables in your `.env` file:
   - Replace `VITE_API_KEY` with your provided API key.
   - Replace `VITE_API_ENDPOINT` with the API endpoint from the Indee API documentation.
